# Simplistic AC3 Implementation for CONS Module

This is a simple implementation of AC3 algorithm for arc consistency in
extension. This implementation was written as half of the assessment for the
CONS (Constraint Programming) module at the University of York.

While it's pretty simplistic and would require modification for use in a proper
constraint solver, it's some quite neat code so I thought I'd upload it anyway.
